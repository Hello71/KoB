# KoB-Browser #
This is a browser-based implementation of the KoB (Kings of Babylon, an empire-building RPG - kob.itch.com) interface, possibly to be expanded into the entire interface some day.

## USAGE ##
Put something like this in `server/config.js`:
    exports.config = {
        root: "/home/user/kob/src"
    };

Run `server/server.js`.
