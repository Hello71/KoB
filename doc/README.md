# KoB-Browser #
This is a browser-based implementation of the KoB ("Kings of Babylon, an empire-building RPG" - kob.itch.com) interface, possibly to be expanded into the entire interface some day.

## USAGE ##
Simply run `node server/start.js.`

## Recommended version ##
I always suggest using `master` at least for now. There *are* release tags, but they are neither guaranteed to be stable nor regular.
